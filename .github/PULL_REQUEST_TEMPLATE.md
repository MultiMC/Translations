# Please use Crowdin instead of direct pull requests

Because we use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/multimc) for most translation work, and it doesn't interact well with direct pull requests here, please do the translations using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/multimc), or [Poedit  connected to Crowdin](https://poedit.net/).

Our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/multimc) site is here and is set up for open contributions:
